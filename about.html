    <main> <p>My name is Ayman Mohamed, I've been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. I've spent most of my life playing sports and working on mastering the game of basketball. I'm extremely excited to be at apart of the CIT program. As a beginner everything I've learned excites me. I feel like I'm learning so much in every class. I've never liked change but for the first time I can say I'm intrigued and excited for new beginnings.</p>
